# SCOPE (System for Coordinated Operations & Police Engagement)
SCOPE is a Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) and Mobile Data Terminal (MDT) system designed to streamline and coordinate law enforcement operations in real-time. It is built for use in roleplay environments like FiveM, but is scalable for real-world simulation and training scenarios. The system provides dispatchers and officers with a unified interface for managing calls, units, reports, and live data efficiently.

### 1. Goals and Objectives
Real-Time Coordination: Provide up-to-date information sharing between dispatchers and field units.

Efficient Workflow: Simplify and accelerate common police tasks such as traffic stops, incident reporting, and warrant checks.

Secure Access: Role-based access to maintain data integrity and operational security.

Auditability: Full logging of activities for administrative review.

### 2. User Roles
| Role           | Permissions                                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Admin**      | Full system access, user management, audit logs                           |
| **Dispatcher** | Manage units, create/edit calls, assign priorities, broadcast BOLOs       |
| **Officer**    | Access MDT, search civilians/vehicles, submit reports, update unit status |
| **Supervisor** | Review reports, manage BOLOs, override decisions                          |
| **Civilian**   | (Optional module for record viewing or requests; e.g., FOIA simulation)   |

### 3. Values and priorititys
This project is designed with the following principles in mind:

‚úÖ Open and Accessible
- 100% free and open-source stack.
- No commercial or OS-dependent software required.
