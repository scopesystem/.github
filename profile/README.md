# SCOPE (System for Coordinated Operations & Police Engagement)
SCOPE is a Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) and Mobile Data Terminal (MDT) system designed to streamline and coordinate law enforcement operations in real-time. It is built for use in roleplay environments like FiveM, but is scalable for real-world simulation and training scenarios. The system provides dispatchers and officers with a unified interface for managing calls, units, reports, and live data efficiently.

### 1. Goals and Objectives
Real-Time Coordination: Provide up-to-date information sharing between dispatchers and field units.

Efficient Workflow: Simplify and accelerate common police tasks such as traffic stops, incident reporting, and warrant checks.

Secure Access: Role-based access to maintain data integrity and operational security.

Auditability: Full logging of activities for administrative review.
